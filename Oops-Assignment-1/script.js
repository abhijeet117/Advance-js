// SECTION 1: Objects and OOPS Thinking (Foundation)

// 	1.	Create a user object that stores name and email
//  and has a login method which prints “User logged in”.




// 	2.	Imagine you now have 5 users.
// First, think how you would manage them without using a class.
// Then convert the same logic using a class and observe
// how the code becomes cleaner. Write code for both approaches.
// 	3.	Create a product object that stores name and 
// price and has a method which returns the final price after discount.

// The goal of this section is to understand why keeping data and behavior together makes code easier to manage.
